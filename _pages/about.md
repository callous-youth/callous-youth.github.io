Introduction  
======
<!-- I recently completed my Ph.D. in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (DLUT) in November 2024. I was affiliated with the Institute of Geometric Computing and Intelligent Media Technology and the Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province. My research was supervised by Prof. [Risheng Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DzuhImQAAAAJ) (National Excellent Young Scholar) and Prof. [Xin Fan](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=vLN1njoAAAAJ) (Dean). 

My research focused on bi-level optimization, encompassing its theoretical foundations, algorithmic advancements, and applications in machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I developed efficient optimization methods to address hierarchical problems in areas such as low-light image enhancement, medical imaging, and adversarial robustness. BLO also served as a foundation for practical applications in meta-learning, neural architecture search, and generative learning.

My academic contributions include 14 publications in leading journals and conferences, including IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, ACM MM, CVPR, AAAI, IJCAI, TIM, and Pattern Recognition, with a cumulative citation count exceeding 250. I have also served as a reviewer for prominent venues, including CVPR, ACM MM, AAAI, and IJCAI. 
In addition to my publications, I contributed to one domestic and two international patents. I also participated in national key R&D and NSFC-funded projects, where I was responsible for designing and implementing optimization-driven solutions for image processing and machine learning tasks. -->


I am a Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (DLUT), expecting to graduate in June 2025. I am affiliated with the Institute of Geometric Computing and Intelligent Media Technology and the Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province. My research is supervised by Prof. [Risheng Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DzuhImQAAAAJ) (National Excellent Young Scholar).  

My research focuses on Bi-Level Optimization (BLO), emphasizing its theoretical foundations, algorithmic advancements, and applications in trustworthy machine learning and multimedia. I develop efficient optimization methods for hierarchical learning problems, such as Meta Learning, Neural Architecture Search, and Generative Aaversarial Networks. Furthermore, I explore constrained learning methods for multimedia applications, including image fusion and super-resolution. My recent research also extends to tailored BLO schemes for trustworthy machine learning, including adversarial defense and black-box transfer attacks for real-world applications like Semanctic Segmentation and Multi-modal Image Generation.  

I have authored 10 SCI/EI papers and have 6 additional papers under review. My first-author publications include contributions to NeurIPS, ICML, IJCAI, and ICME,  among others. I have also contributed to two international patents. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for leading conferences and journals, including CVPR, ACM MM, AAAI, and IJCAI.  

Beyond research, I actively participate in national key R&D and NSFC-funded projects, designing and implementing optimization-driven solutions for image processing and machine learning tasks.
