Introduction  
======
I recently completed my Ph.D. in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in September 2024. I was affiliated with the Institute of Geometric Computing and Intelligent Media Technology and the Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province. My research was supervised by Prof. Risheng Liu (National Excellent Young Scholar) and Prof. Xin Fan (Dean).

My research focused on **Bi-Level Optimization (BLO)**, encompassing its theoretical foundations, algorithmic advancements, and applications in machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I developed efficient optimization methods to address hierarchical problems in areas such as low-light image enhancement, medical imaging, and adversarial robustness. BLO also served as a foundation for practical applications in meta-learning, neural architecture search, and generative learning.

I hold an M.S. in Computational Mathematics (2020) and a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (2018) from DUT, where I was mentored by Prof. Zhixun Su. My academic contributions include 12 publications (5 as first or co-first author) in leading journals and conferences, including **IEEE TPAMI**, **IEEE TNNLS**, **ACM MM**, and **Pattern Recognition**, with a cumulative citation count exceeding 250. I have also served as a reviewer for prominent venues, including **CVPR**, **ACM MM**, **AAAI**, and **IJCAI**.

In addition to my publications, I contributed to one domestic and two international patents. I also participated in national key R&D and NSFC-funded projects, where I was responsible for designing and implementing optimization-driven solutions for image processing and machine learning tasks.


<!-- I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (DUT), with an expected graduation date in September 2024. I am affiliated with the Institute of Geometric Computing and Intelligent Media Technology and the Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province. My research is supervised by Prof. Risheng Liu (National Excellent Young Scholar) and Prof. Xin Fan (Dean).  

My primary research focuses on **Bi-Level Optimization (BLO)**, encompassing its theoretical foundations, algorithmic development, and diverse applications in machine learning and computer vision. I explore hierarchical coupling challenges in tasks such as low-light image enhancement, medical imaging, and adversarial robustness, aiming to develop efficient optimization strategies to address these complex problems. BLO is a powerful framework for tackling high-dimensional and multi-task visual applications, with notable utility in meta-learning, neural architecture search, and generative learning.  

I previously earned my M.S. in Computational Mathematics (2020) and B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (2018) from DUT, under the mentorship of Prof. Zhixun Su. My academic contributions include 12 publications (5 as first or co-first author) in leading journals and conferences, including **IEEE TPAMI**, **IEEE TNNLS**, **ACM MM**, and **Pattern Recognition**, with a cumulative citation count exceeding 250. In addition, I actively serve as a reviewer for prominent venues such as **CVPR**, **ACM MM**, **AAAI**, **IJCAI**, and **NeurIPS**.  

Beyond my research contributions, I have been involved in patent development, contributing to one domestic and two international patents. I have also participated in multiple national key R&D projects and NSFC-funded initiatives, where I addressed practical challenges in robust visual perception under adverse conditions.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
