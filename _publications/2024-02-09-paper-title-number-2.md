excerpt: 'The complexity of learning problems, such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants, multi-task and meta-learning, hyper-parameter learning, and a variety of real-world vision applications, demands a deeper understanding of their underlying coupling mechanisms. Existing approaches often address these problems in isolation, lacking a unified perspective that can reveal commonalities and enable effective solutions. Therefore, in this work, we proposed a new framework, named Learning with Constraint Learning (LwCL), that can holistically examine challenges and provide a unified methodology to tackle all the above-mentioned complex learning and vision problems. Specifically, LwCL is designed as a general hierarchical optimization model that captures the essence of these diverse learning and vision problems. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-response based fast solution strategy to overcome optimization challenges of the LwCL framework. Our proposed framework efficiently addresses a wide range of applications in learning and vision, encompassing three categories and nine different problem types. Extensive experiments on synthetic tasks and real-world applications verify the effectiveness of our approach. The LwCL framework offers a comprehensive solution for tackling complex machine learning and computer vision problems, bridging the gap between theory and practice.'

The complexity of learning problems, such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants, multi-task and meta-learning, hyper-parameter learning, and a variety of real-world vision applications, demands a deeper understanding of their underlying coupling mechanisms. Existing approaches often address these problems in isolation, lacking a unified perspective that can reveal commonalities and enable effective solutions. Therefore, in this work, we proposed a new framework, named Learning with Constraint Learning (LwCL), that can holistically examine challenges and provide a unified methodology to tackle all the above-mentioned complex learning and vision problems. Specifically, LwCL is designed as a general hierarchical optimization model that captures the essence of these diverse learning and vision problems. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-response based fast solution strategy to overcome optimization challenges of the LwCL framework. Our proposed framework efficiently addresses a wide range of applications in learning and vision, encompassing three categories and nine different problem types. Extensive experiments on synthetic tasks and real-world applications verify the effectiveness of our approach. The LwCL framework offers a comprehensive solution for tackling complex machine learning and computer vision problems, bridging the gap between theory and practice.
